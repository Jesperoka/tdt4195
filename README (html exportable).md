<h2 align="center">Part 1: Convolutional Neural Networks</h2>

<h2 align="left">Task 1: Theory</h2>

<h3 align="left">a)</h3>

**Question:**

Given a single convolutional layer with a stride of 1, kernel size of 7 × 7, and 6 filters. If I
want the output shape (Height × Width) of the convolutional layer to be equal to the input image,
how much padding should I use on each side?

**Answer:**

The padding $p_i$ required on each side of dimension $i$, where $i \le k$, of a $k$-dimensional unit-stride convolutional kernel $K_{a_0 \times a_1 \times ... \times a_k}$ if we want the output dimension to be equal to the input dimension, is $p_i = \lfloor \frac{a_i}{2} \rfloor$.

Thus for a unit stride convolutional kernel $K_{7 \times 7}$ we have $p_i = \lfloor \frac{7}{2} \rfloor = 3$ for $i \in {0,1}$ corresponding to height and width dimensions.

<h3 align="left">b)</h3>

Consider a CNN whose inputs are RGB color images of size 512×512. The network has two convolutional
layers. Using this information, answer the following:

**Question:**

You are told that the spatial dimensions of the feature maps in the first layer are 506 × 506,
and that there are 12 feature maps in the first layer. Assuming that no padding is used, the stride
is 1, and the kernel used are square, and of an odd size, what are the spatial dimensions of these
kernels? Give the answer as (Height) × (Width).

**Answer:**

The equations for the output shape of a 2D convolution layer are

```math
\begin{align}
    w_{\text{output}} &= \frac{w_{\text{input}} - w_{\text{kernel}} + w_{\text{padding start}} + w_{\text{padding end}} }{w_{\text{stride}}} + 1 \\[3pt]
    h_{\text{output}} &= \frac{h_{\text{input}} - h_{\text{kernel}} + h_{\text{padding start}} + h_{\text{padding end}} }{h_{\text{stride}}} + 1 \\[3pt]
    c_{\text{output}} &= \text{num\_filters}
\end{align}
```

We are given that

```math
\begin{align}
    w_{\text{output}} &= h_{\text{output}} = 506 \\[3pt]
    w_{stride} &= h_{stride} = 1, \\[3pt]
    h_{\text{kernel}} &= w_{\text{kernel}}
\end{align}
```

and there is no padding. 

We get

```math
\begin{align}
    &506 = \frac{512 - h_{\text{kernel}} + 0 + 0 }{1} + 1 \\[3pt]
    \implies &h_{\text{kernel}} = w_{\text{kernel}} = 512 - (506 - 1) = 7 \\[3pt]
    \implies &h_{\text{kernel}} \times w_{\text{kernel}} = 7 \times 7 
\end{align}
```

<h3 align="left">c)</h3>

**Question:**

If subsampling is done using neighborhoods of size 2 × 2, with a stride of 2, what are the
spatial dimensions of the pooled feature maps in the first layer? (assume the input has a shape of
506 × 506). Give the answer as (Height) × (Width).

**Answer:**

Pooling (subsampling) using a $2 \times 2$ kernel with stride $2$, assuming no padding or dilation (i.e. dilation=1), gives an  output of

```math
h_{\text{output}} \times w_{\text{ouput}} = 253 \times 253
```

<h3 align="left">d)</h3>

**Question:**

The spatial dimensions of the convolution kernels in the second layer are 3 × 3. Assuming
no padding and a stride of 1, what are the sizes of the feature maps in the second layer? (assume
the input shape is the answer from the last task). Give the answer as (Height) × (Width).

**Answer:**

Passing a $252 \times 253$ spatial dimension input from the previous layer and applying a $3 \times 3$ kernel with stride $1$ and no padding results in reduction of $2$ in bothe height and width, giving
```math
h_{\text{output}} \times w_{\text{ouput}} = 251 \times 251 
```

<h3 align="left">e)</h3>

**Question:**

[Table 1](#table-1) shows a simple CNN. How many parameters are there in the network? In this
network, the number of parameters is the number of weights + the number of biases. Assume the
network takes in an 32 × 32 image.

<a name="table-1"></a>
| Layer | Layer Type | Number of Hidden Units/Filters | Activation   |
|-------|------------|--------------------------------|--------------|
|   1   | Conv2D(kernel_size=5, stride=1, padding=2)  | 32 | ReLU    |
|   1   | MaxPool(kernel_size=2, stride=2)            |    |         |
|   2   | Conv2D(kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)  | 64 | ReLU    |
|   2   | MaxPool(kernel_size=2, stride=2)            |    |         |
|   3   | Conv2D(kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1)  | 128| ReLU    |
|   3   | MaxPool(kernel_size=2, stride=2)            |    |         |
|       | Flatten()                                   |    |         |
|   4   | Linear(in_features=?, out_features=64)      | 64 | ReLU    |
|   5   | Linear(in_features=64, out_features=10)     | 10 | Softmax |
<p align="center"><b>Table 1</b>: Architecture of a simple convolutional neural network.</p>

**Answer:**

The weight and bias tensors of Conv2D layers have shapes 
```math
\begin{align}
    W_{\text{shape}} &= c_\text{output} \times c_\text{input} \times h_{\text{kernel}} \times w_{\text{kernel}} \\[3pt]
    \mathbf{b}_{\text{shape}} &= c_\text{output} \times 1
\end{align}
```
The weight and bias tensors of Linear layers have shapes
```math
\begin{align}
    W_{\text{shape}} &= h_\text{output} \times h_{\text{input}} \\[3pt]
    \mathbf{b}_{\text{shape}} &= h_\text{output} \times 1
\end{align}
```
MaxPool, ReLU and Softmax do not have any trainable parameters.

Thus, assuming RGB image inputs, for the Conv2D layers we have 
```math
\begin{align}
    {N_{\text{params}}}_1 &= (32 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5) + 32 = 2432 \\[3pt]
    {N_{\text{params}}}_2 &= (64 \cdot 32 \cdot 3 \cdot 3) + 64 = 18496 \\[3pt]
    {N_{\text{params}}}_3 &= (128 \cdot 64 \cdot 3 \cdot 3) + 128 = 73856 
\end{align}
```
and the spatial dimension of the image will have been halved $3$ times from the max pooling operations by the time it's flattened, meaning we have a $4 \times 4 \times 128$ feature map.
<br><br>This gives us
```math
\begin{align}
    {N_{\text{params}}}_4 &= (64 \cdot (4 \cdot 4 \cdot 128)) + 64 = 131136 \\[3pt]
    {N_{\text{params}}}_5 &= (10 \cdot 64) + 10 = 650
\end{align}
```
for a total of
```math
\begin{align}
    {N_{\text{params}}} &= {N_{\text{params}}}_1 + {N_{\text{params}}}_2 + {N_{\text{params}}}_3 + {N_{\text{params}}}_4 + {N_{\text{params}}}_5 \\[3pt]
    {N_{\text{params}}} &= 226570 
\end{align}
```

<h2 align="left">Task 2: Programming</h2>

<h3 align="left">a)</h3>

**Question:**

Implement the network in Table 1. Implement this in the jupyter notebook (or python file)
task2.py/ipynb. Report the final accuracy on the validation set for the trained network. Include
a plot of the training and validation loss during training.

By looking at the final train/validation loss/accuracy, do you see any evidence of overfitting?
Shortly summarize your reasoning.

**Answer:**

The final validation loss was $0.0348$, and the final validation accuracy was $0.9894$. [Figure 1](#figure-1) shows the training and validation losses during training.
<br>*Note: test and validation are used interchangably in these tasks.*

<h3 align="center">Task 2a Train and Test Losses</h3>

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 1: </b>Five epochs of training is enough to learn the relatively simple MNIST dataset.</p>

Because the training and validation losses are closely aligned, we conclude that there is no evidence of overfitting. Furthermore the validation loss was still decreasing at the end of training.

<h3 align="left">b)</h3>

**Question:**

The optimizer in pytorch is the method we use to update our gradients. Till now, we have
used standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Understanding what the different optimizers do
is out of the scope of this course, but we want to make you aware that they exist. 

Adam is one of the most popular optimizers currently. Change the SGD optimizer to Adam (use
torch.optim.Adam instead of torch.optim.SGD), and train your model from scratch.

Use a learning rate of 0.001.

Plot the training/validation loss from both models (the model with Adam and the one with SGD)
in the same graph and include this in your report. (Note, you should probably change the plt.ylim
argument to [0, 0.1]).

**Answer:**

It wasn't quite clear weather SGD should be run with the same learning rate as Adam, or if we were meant to use the learning rate from before, so [Figure 2](#figure-2) includes both cases.

<h3 align="left">c)</h3>

**Question:**

Interpreting CNNs is a challenging task. One way of doing this, is to visualize the learned
weights in the first layer as a K × K × 3 image 2, where K is the kernel size.

Understanding what the filter does can be difficult. Therefore, we can visualize the activation by
passing an image through a given filter. The result of this will be a grayscale image.

Run the image zebra.jpg through the first layer of the ResNet50 network. Visualize the filter, and
the grayscale activation of a the filter, by plotting them side by side. 

Use the pre-trained network
ResNet50 and visualize the convolution filters with indices [5, 8, 19, 22, 34].

Include the visualized filters and activations in your report.

**Answer:**

<h3 align="left">d)</h3>

**Question:**

Looking at the visualized filter, and its corresponding activation on the zebra image, describe
what kind of feature each filter extracts. Explain your reasoning.

**Answer:**

Filter 5: Vertical dark-light contrast edges with about 4-5 pixels of dark and light areas the the left and right of the edges.
Filter 8: Down-right diagonal bright lines on darker background 1-2 pixels thick (about 45 degree angle).
Filter 19: Relatively uniformly green areas.
Filter 22: Up-right diagonal bright lines on darker background 1-2 pixels thick (about 30 degree angle).
Filter 34: Relatively uniformly blue areas.

The learned filters, visualized as RGB images show how the activation for a given pixel in the output is affected by its neighboring pixels in all 3 RGB channels. For instance, because of the way the zebra is positioned in the image, filter 5 results in more regions of low and high activations, wheras filter 22 only really gives strong activations either way on the face of the zebra and somewhat around its outline where the white areas on the zebra create a contrasting line with the background and the black areas on the zebra. Filter 8 corresponds to quite a few areas, but the stripes on the zebra make lines that are too thick for the filter in most cases.

Clearly blue and green are also salient features for images that have sky, water and grassy areas. 

Note that the grass being a more yellow color also plays into the activation of the green area detecting filter, giving the network a chance to differentiate between climates which might help in classifying a striped animal in an area with a yellow background versus one in an area with a very lush green background.

<h2 align="center">Part 2: Filtering in the Frequency Domain</h2>

<h2 align="left">Task 3: Theory</h2>

<h3 align="left">a)</h3>

**Question:**

Given the images in the spatial and frequency domain in [Figure 4](#figure-4), pair each image in the
spatial domain (first row) with a single image in the frequency domain (second row). Explain your
reasoning.

<h3 align="center">Task 3a 2D Discrete Fourier Transform</h3>
<a name="figure-4"></a>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Jesperoka/tdt4195/blob/assignment_5/imgs/task3a_imgs.png?raw=true" width=600>
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 4: </b>A set of images visualized in the spatial domain (first row) and the frequency domain (second row).
The frequency images visualizes the amplitude |F{g}|.
</p>

**Answer:**

The amplitude of the discrete time fourier transform is represented by color in the amplitude plots, so we can interperet a white dot at (u, v) on a black background a there being a very defined sinusoid frequency along the direction (u, v) of the input image. In this case all the images have oscillating colors along either x or y only. All images also have areas (in both directions) of constant color, corresponding to the truncated delta function (white dot) in the middle of the amplitude image.

Based on this we can, by ordering the images from low to high frequency along the x and y directions respectively, determine the corresponding amplitude plots.

We have the following low-to-high frequency orderings
```math
\begin{align}
    X_{\text{direction}} &= (1d, 1f, 1e) \\[3pt]
    Y_{\text{direction}} &= (1c, 1b, 1a)
\end{align}
```
which gives ut the one-to-one correspondence
```math
\begin{align}
    H_{\text{bijection}} &= \{(1d, 2b), (1f, 2a), (1e, 2d), (1c, 2f), (1b, 2c), (1a, 2e)\} 
\end{align}
```

<h3 align="left">b)</h3>

**Question:**

What are high-pass and low-pass filters?

**Answer:**

High-pass filters are filters that pass through high frequency signal components, this means they remove low frequency signal components.
Low-pass filters are filters that pass through low frequency signal components, this means they remove high frequency signal components.

These are the general descriptions of their idealized function. In practice they approximate this behaviour by attenuating signals that are not supposed to be passed through, and make an effort to not attenuate signals that are supposed to be passed through. How effectively they do this is dependent on their area of application (electronics, image processing, optics, audio, estimation and continuous/discrete).

<h3 align="left">c)</h3>

**Question:**

The amplitude |F{g}| of two commonly used convolution kernels can be seen in [Figure 5](#figure-5).
For each kernel (a, and b), figure out what kind of kernel it is (high- or low-pass). 

Shortly explain your reasoning.

<h3 align="center">Task 3c Amplitude Plots for Commonly Used Convolution Kernels</h3>
<a name="figure-5"></a>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Jesperoka/tdt4195/blob/assignment_5/imgs/task3c_imgs.png?raw=true" width=350>
</p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 5: </b>The amplitude |F{g}| of two convolution kernels that have been transformed by the Fourier transform.
The DC component have been shifted to the center for all images. This means that low frequencies can be found
around the center of each image, while high frequencies can be found far from the center of each image.</p>

**Answer:**

A low-pass filtering kernel, in some sense, averages the input, so we expect the kernel itself to have more uniform values, thus giving it mostly low frequencies in all spatialdirections. The high-pass filtering kernel does somewhat the opposite, having sharp differences in the kernel values, leading to higher frequencies in the spatial directions. 

Thus, 5a is the high-pass filter and 5b is the low-pass filter.


<h2 align="left">Task 4: Programming</h2>

<h3 align="left">a)</h3>

**Question:**

Implement a function that takes an grayscale image, and a kernel in the frequency domain, and applies the convolution theorem (seen in Equation 4). Try it out on a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter on the grayscale image "camera man" (im = skimage.data.camera()).

Include in your report the filtered images and the before/after amplitude |F{f}| of the transform.
Make sure to shift the zero-frequency component to the center before displaying the amplitude.

Implement this in the function convolve_im in task4a.py/task4a.ipynb. The high-pass and
low-pass filter is already defined in the starter code.

You will observe a "ringing" effect in the filtered image. What is the cause of this?

**Answer:**

[Figure 6](#figure-6) shows process of applying the convolution theorem for the two cases in the question.

<h3 align="center">Task 4a Convolution Theorem Applied to Low- and High-pass filtering</h3>
<a name="figure-6"></a>
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Jesperoka/tdt4195/blob/assignment_5/imgs/task4a_imgs_1.png?raw=true" width=600>

</p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 6: </b><br>Top: Low-pass filter.<br>Bottom: High-pass filter.<br>Note that the amplitude plots are log-amplitude plots for better visualization as is common.</p>

If you google the ringing effect "Gibbs phenomenon" you will first of all get the answer that the effect comes from a signal being band-limited. In particular the effect comes from the truncation of a fourier series used to represent a time/spatial domain signal, leading to an overshoot and exponentially decaying sinusoids (ringing effect). Since we are dealing with finite discrete signals, we are also dealing with truncated fourier transforms, and in our particular case we have frequency domain kernels that are idealized and discontinuous, which necessitates oscillatory behaviour in the spatial domain of the kernel, with which we are convolving our image. 

*Apparently this all also has to do with convergence of the fourier series to the function it represents not being uniform or pointwise.*

<h3 align="left">b)</h3>

**Question:**

Implement a function that takes an grayscale image, and a kernel in the spatial domain,
and applies the convolution theorem. Try it out on the gaussian kernel given in assignment 1, and
a horizontal sobel filter (Gx).

Make sure to shift the zero-frequency component to the center before displaying the amplitude.
Implement this in the function convolve_im in task4b.py/task4b.ipynb. The gaussian and sobel
filter are already defined in the starter code.

**Question:**

Now we will create a function to automatically find the rotation of scanned documents, such
that we can align the text along the horizontal axis.

You will use the frequency domain to extract a binary image which draws a rough line describing
the rotation of each document. From this, we can use a Hough transform to find a straight line
intersecting most of the points in the binary image. When we have this line, we can easily find the
rotation of the line and the document.

Your task is to generate the binary image by using the frequency spectrum. See Figure 6 which
shows you what to expect. We’ve implemented most of the code for you in this task; you only need
to alter the function create_binary_image in task4d.py/task4.ipynb.
